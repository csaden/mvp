There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Writelet

## Sub-Heading ##
  Giving a chance for all learners to respond.

## Summary ##
  Writelet is a simple application that allows teachers to write questions for all students to answer. Teachers can pose discussion topics to learners or solicit examples and explanations from learners. By asking all learners to response, teachers can get a better sense of what students are thinking for what teachers deem to be the most critical content in a lesson.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Learners in a wide range of learning environments don't always get a chance to participate. One traditional classroom approach relies on cold calling students on a per question basis. This approach is often used to sample student understanding, but it only allows one or a few students to demonstrate their thinking. Cold calling also does not allow educators to know the spectrum of language (the words students actually use) or understanding that learners have for a given topic. To further complicate matters, teachers may be unconciously biased in who they choose to cold call. Teachers may be call on certain genders more favorably, or they may call on particular students knowing the quality of the answer that they would expect from the learner. While the latter tactic can be used effectively to draw out student misconceptions, it can leave students feeling on the hook for a correct repsonse or embarrassed about their misconceptions. There should be a way better to involve all learners and to let teachers more quickly check for understanding.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Writelet allow teachers to pose questions or prompts to all students. Students can then submit responses, which can be viewed anonymously to all other students. While teachers have access to all responses and the corresponding names of the learners, students can only view the submissions and not who wrote them. This can alleviate the stress for students to respond with the "correct" answer, and it also allows learners to take more risks in voicing their thoughts. Teachers also have the option of showing particular responses to guide classroom discussion or to gauge students current understanding of a topic in a short time window. Writelet can be used in physical classroom, synchronous digital learning enviroments, or even async learning environments, which makes it a useful tool for any educator.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  To get started, go to writelet.com. A teacher can create a question. That question will generate a link that all students can use to submit their responses. No registration is required by the teacher, but if a teacher would like to set up tracking of student responses, then the teacher can set up a class roster and student's can

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
